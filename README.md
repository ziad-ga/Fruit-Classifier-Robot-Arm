# fruit-classifier-robot-arm
This is a project to classify and sort fruits using Arduino with ComputerVision and a 6DOF arm.

Here is the list of components that we used:
- Arduino
- 6DOF Robot Arm
- Laptop with a USB webcam
- Power Supply

We used an old PCU to supply all motors with power.

If you want more information about the circuit feel free to contact me.
